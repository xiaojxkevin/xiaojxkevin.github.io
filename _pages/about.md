#### Current Stage

I am now interning at [MPL](https://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/MPL@shanghaitech.html) at ShanghaiTech University.

#### My Interests 

In the realm of research, I am interested in computer vision. As for the topic of daily life, I am fond of reading sci-fi books, watching anime series.
