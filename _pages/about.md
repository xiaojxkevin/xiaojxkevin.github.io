I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science.

#### Current Stage

I am now interning at [MPL](https://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/MPL@shanghaitech.html) at ShanghaiTech University.

#### My Interests 

In the realm of research, my focus lies within computer vision, where I possess experience in both `SLAM` and `Deep Learning` methodologies. Additionally, I harbor a keen interest in mathematics. I find myself irresistibly drawn to exploring its paradoxical nature: while inherently complex, many complex systems are underpinned by fundamental and trivial principles. These principles, as I think of, are the true engines driving the functionality of our world.
